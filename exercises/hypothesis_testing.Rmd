Hypothesis testing problems

## Problem 1

Vacation data
```{r}
qqnorm(vacation)
qqline(vacation)
```
Soo...a test for the mean is appropriate. So t-test.

```{r}
t.test(vacation, mu=24, alternative = 'less')
```

## Problem 2

Same thing for pH levels for water samples in the Great Smoky Mountains

```{r}
data = smokyph$waterph
qqnorm(data); qqline(data)
```
Looks skewed to the left. So we do a test for the median.

```{r}
wilcox.test(data, mu=7, alternative = 'greater')
```
Small p-value. We reject the hypothesis.

## Problem 3

```{r}
prop.test(440, 900, p=.5)
```
Yeah. Bush can be said to have received 50% of the votes.

```{r}
stomach = cancer$stomach

wilcox.test(stomach, mu=100)
```
Big p-value, so it may be 100 days of survival with stomach cancer and vitamin C. :(
